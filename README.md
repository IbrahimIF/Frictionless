A project designed to reduce time in indenting, keeping a consistent structure throughout their code and can help others identify where the syntax error in the code is and give information on the Code snippet provided, such as the programming language, cyclomatic complexity of the code and many more and flag any potential errors found to give a more smoother development experience.

Allowing the usage of any programming language code snippet as an input, for the software to analyse, detect, and Improve the code, giving an output.

## Features:

This Project includes:
- **Inputs & Outputs**: Accepts any form of code snippets and output the results, displaying the analysis, errors detected and improvements as an output.

- **Code Analysis**:  Identify and extract fixed set of details taken from a code snippet such as number of comments or programming language used.

- **Syntax Error Detection**: Detects basic syntax errors taken from any code snippet such as missed placed brackets and inform the user.

- - **Automatic Code Indentation**: Organises and indents the inputted code snippet.

- **Theme Selection**: Choose and change the colour theme of the input and output sections.

- **Code Language Selection**: Choose the programming Language of the inputted code snippet.
